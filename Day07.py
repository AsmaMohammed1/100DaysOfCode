Idea = '''
- \"String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or
double quotation marks.
- Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an
equal sign and the string.
- Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.
- Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
